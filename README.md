👋 Hi, I’m Allen

I’m a quantitative machine learning engineer with a background in applied mathematics and a strong focus on AI innovation in finance and science. My work spans across domains—from classifying neural signals to predicting cosmic structures and uncovering patterns in financial systems—using a wide range of ML tools including graph learning, LLMs, and deep learning.

I’m especially interested in building scalable, intelligent systems that combine cutting-edge ML research with robust engineering practices to solve real-world problems.
